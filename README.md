#  vidX ‚Äì Online MP4 Video Link Extractor

**vidX** is a browser-based tool that extracts direct `.mp4` video URLs from websites using network sniffing via Puppeteer.

It is built for users who want to generate **direct download links** for videos served through `.mp4` requests (as seen in browser network activity).

##  What It Does ?

- üïµÔ∏è Scans the target page like a real browser (headless)
- üîé Looks for `.mp4` requests made during page load
- üì• Returns a **direct downloadable link** if found
- üö´ Does **not** download the video on the server ‚Äî just gives the link

---

## ‚úÖ Supported

- Sites that serve videos via `.mp4` files in network requests (visible in browser DevTools > Network)
- Pages where the video loads after a short delay or via JS

---

## ‚ùå Not Supported (Currently)

- HLS streams (`.m3u8`)
- DASH / MPEG-DASH (`.mpd`)
- DRM-protected content
- Blob URLs
- YouTube and platforms with heavily obfuscated video loading

---

##  How It Works

1. You paste a URL (e.g., `https://somevideo.com/watch/abc`)
2. The server launches a headless browser and visits the page
3. It watches all network requests for any `.mp4` files
4. Once a match is found, it stops and returns the link
